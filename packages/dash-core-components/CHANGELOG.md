# Change Log for dash-core-components
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## [0.6.0] - 2017-07-18
### Added
- The `Slider` and the `RangeSlider` component can update when the user finishes dragging the slider rather than just while they drag. The default behaviour has remained the same (updates while dragging) but you can toggle that the updates only get fired on "mouse up" by setting `updatemode` to `'mouseup'` (`'drag'` is the default).
- A `Link` and `Location` were added. `Location` represents the address bar of the web browser and `Link` provides a way to modify the address bar without refreshing the page. Combined, these two components can be used to create a "single page app" with multiple URLs. That is, apps that have mulitple URLs but surfing between the different pages doesn't trigger a full page refresh like it would with traditional links.
- Previously, if callback functions weren't supplied to a component, it wouldn't update. This caused a lot of confusion: users would create a simple layout without any callbacks and then wonder why the sliders wouldn't slide or the text inputs wouldn't update. Now, all of the components manage their own state and their appearance will update regardless of whether Dash has assigned a callback to them.

## [0.5.3] - 2017-07-03
### Added
- A `range` object is now included in the `selectedData` object that specifies
  that dimensions of the selected region.
- A `lassoPoints` object is now included in the `selectedData` object that
  provides coordinates of the lassoed region.

## [0.5.2] - 2017-07-03
### Added
- A new property `clear_on_unhover` on the `Graph` component will clear the
  `hoverData` property when the user "unhovers" from a point if True. If False,
  then the `hoverData` property will be equal to the data from the last point
  that was hovered over. The default is False.
