pkg_help_description: >
    Dash is a web application framework that
    provides pure Python and R abstraction around HTML, CSS, and
    JavaScript. Instead of writing HTML or using an HTML
    templating engine, you compose your layout using R
    functions within the dashHtmlComponents package. The
    source for this package is on GitHub:
    plotly/dash-html-components.
